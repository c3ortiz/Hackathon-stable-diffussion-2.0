In this video, Michael discusses the concept of last Thursdayism, which is the belief that the universe was created last Thursday. He explains that while it cannot be proven false, it falls into the domain of philosophy rather than science. Michael then explores how future archaeologists will view our society and how we will be remembered. He discusses the concept of entropy and how it contributes to the universe's growing disorder, and how even being lazy can contribute to postponing the inevitable dispersal of energy. Ultimately, Michael concludes that while history may forget us, our contribution to the universe's entropy will never be forgotten.
